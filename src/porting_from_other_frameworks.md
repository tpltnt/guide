# Porting from other frameworks

Nannou is inspired by other creative coding frameworks inspired like [Processing](https://processing.org),
[openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc), and [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/).
This section is intended to help everyone making the switch to nannou and bringing their code with them.
